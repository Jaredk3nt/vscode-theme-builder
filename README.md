# VS Theme Builder

Building VS Code themes isn't terribly complex but the process is tedious and the docs are confusing for newcomers. This project aims to take the hassle out of creating your own VS Code themes by giving you a drag and drop GUI with live feedback to help you prototype and ship themes easier than ever.

## Roadmap

This project is in it's infancy and I hope to continue making strides towards the goal of simplifying theme making. Here is a general outline of goals to accomplish to make this possible:

- ~~Display "themed" code in the browser~~
  - Make the process of creating new example previews easier than manually creating them
- Create and customize "tokens" styling
- Drag and drop theme scopes between tokens
- Import existing themes as bases
- Filter and search scopes with a tagging system to make them easier to understand and find
- Highlighting tool tips on example previews to show scopes
- Export created themes to theme files
- Save themes to continue working on in another session
- Share/fork themes from a central location

## Contributing

There is a lot of work to be done to make this project viable to replace the manual process of creating themes. Before beginning to work look for open issues or reach out to me to see what needs to be worked on next. All changes should be made through forking the repo and making pull requests once the work is finished.
